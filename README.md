# Fillit
Fillit - 42 Project

# Methods
- Linked List for pieces storage because of non-predefined list size and linear browsing.
- Pieces stored as 4 coordinates for easier position check on 2D grid.
- Backtracking with piece placement position check as constrain.
- Start a minimum grid size calculated according to number of pieces and upsize the grid if all positions have been tried.
